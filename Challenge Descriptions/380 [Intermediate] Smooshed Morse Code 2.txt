Smooshed Morse code means Morse code with the spaces or other delimiters between encoded letters left out. See this week's Easy challenge for more detail.

A permutation of the alphabet is a 26-character string in which each of the letters a through z appears once.

Given a smooshed Morse code encoding of a permutation of the alphabet, find the permutation it encodes, or any other permutation that produces the same encoding (in general there will be more than one). It's not enough to write a program that will eventually finish after a very long period of time: run your code through to completion for at least one example.

Examples
smalpha(".--...-.-.-.....-.--........----.-.-..---.---.--.--.-.-....-..-...-.---..--.----..")
    => "wirnbfzehatqlojpgcvusyxkmd"
smalpha(".----...---.-....--.-........-----....--.-..-.-..--.--...--..-.---.--..-.-...--..-")
    => "wzjlepdsvothqfxkbgrmyicuna"
smalpha("..-...-..-....--.---.---.---..-..--....-.....-..-.--.-.-.--.-..--.--..--.----..-..")
    => "uvfsqmjazxthbidyrkcwegponl"
Again, there's more than one valid output for these inputs.

Optional bonus 1
Here's a list of 1000 inputs. [https://gist.github.com/cosmologicon/415be8987a24a3abd07ba1dddc3cf389#file-smorse2-bonus1-in]
    How fast can you find the output for all of them? A good time depends on your language of choice and setup, so there's no specific time to aim for.

Optional bonus 2
Typically, a valid input will have thousands of possible outputs. The object of this bonus challenge is to find a valid input with as few possible outputs as possible, while still having at least 1. The following encoded string has 41 decodings:

......-..--...---.-....---...--....--.-..---.....---.-.---..---.-....--.-.---.-.--
Can you do better? When this post is 7 days old, I'll award +1 gold medal flair to the submission with the fewest possible decodings. I'll break ties by taking the lexicographically first string. That is, I'll look at the first character where the two strings differ and award the one with a dash (-) in that position, since - is before . lexicographically.

Notes:
- Depth-First search
- Each node holds what is left of the morse code string, a hashmap mapping each morse code characters to english characters, a pointer to the parent node, pointers to 4 children nodes (cases where the morse code character takes up 1-4 dots and dashes), current string in english characters
- Start by searching the hashmap for the largest dot/dash pattern (starting with 4)
    - if success, add the english character to the result, pass the hashmap with the character removed to the child
        - Removing the character from the hashmap prevents from having to verify each english character is used only once
    - if failure, search for the next smallest dot/dash patter (if 4 fails, search for 3, etc.)
- When a full result is found, either return it immediately, or add the string to a result list and return all possible results at the end
