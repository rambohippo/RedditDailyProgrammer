Description
A number is input in computer then a new number should be printed by adding one to each of its digits. If you encounter a 9, insert a 10 (don't carry over, just shift things around).

For example, 998 becomes 10109.

Bonus
This challenge is trivial to do if you map it to a string to iterate over the input, operate, and then cast it back. Instead, try doing it without casting it as a string at any point, keep it numeric (int float if you need it) only.

Notes
Wrote function to also work for negative numbers. In a negative number, each digit is treated as negative.
